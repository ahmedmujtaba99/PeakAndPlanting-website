            <p> <b>FarmerStory:</b> Our tomato seedling farmer Raja Musheer is from Katha Saghral village in Khushab. His tomato field was suffering from diseases due to soil and rainy conditions of the area. The farmers of the area were planning to quit tomato in future.</p>
            <p>HajiSons team came on board to provide full technical support to Raja Musheer. We introduced the new technology of “Stacking” in his field with the collaboration of our foreign expert</p>
            <p>Raja was surprised to witness fewer disease attacks blighting his crops while using fewer pesticides than he normally would. Fruit size and per plant yield also increased. Mostly, he is proud that these new techniques have resulted in healthy crops that will boost his income. Although just starting out, he hopes to learn even more about improved farming techniques to further increase his quality of life</p>
